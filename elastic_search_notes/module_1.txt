What is elastic search?

Elasticsearch is an open source analytics and full-text search engine.

It is often used for enabling search functionality in applications.

You can build complex search functionality with Elasticsearch, similar to what you see you see in google.

This includes:
[
	auto-completion,
	correcting typos,
	highlighting matches, 
	handling synonyms,
	adjusting relevance,
	etc.
]

Not only search, you can do analysis on your structured data.

You many even use it as machine learning or data science tool to make insights or forcasts based on your data. 

What you can do as whole with elastic search?

full-text search engine
analysis,
prediction,
anomaly detection,
alot more.


This course mainly focuses on searching.
---------------------------------------

Elastic search is written in Java on the top of Apache Lucene.

It is easy to use, configurable and highly scalable.


In elasticsearch, Data is stored as documents(JSON objects)(similar to Mongodb)

We can query the documents using REST API.

----------------------------------------


Elastic Stack:

Elasticsearch: (Our main focus)

Kibana: Data visualization tool that queries data using API. (very data stored in elastic search.) It can be used as monitoring tool as well. (monitoring for real-time traffic, errors, kpi, etc.)


Logstash: Traditionally, Process logs froms apps and send them to elastic search. But we can use this tool for many other use-cases.
