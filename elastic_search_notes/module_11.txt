Joining queries.

Like NOSQL databases, elasticsearch stores data in de-normalized form.
It contributes to wastage of space, due to redundancy.

But storing data in de-normalized form enhance performance in searching.

So, elasticsearch should be used only for search and analysis purposes.

This is why, It's not recommended to use elasticsearch as primary data store for the application.

Performance > Storage space

Hence, unlike relational databases such as Mysql/Postgres, elasticsearch doesn't support joins.

However, there are few ways to do simple joining data across documents.

But these queries are ineffecient.
