Important for searching!

Text index splits up the words and removes all the stopwords such as (the, in, of, etc) and stores every word of value as stem word in lowercase.

Note:
You can use text-index only on one field / collection.(so that field should possibly be in every document in collection).
However, you can merge multiple fields while creating text-index

createIndex({field:"text"})

For e.g:

createIndex({"description":"text"}) where the description is the field.

Searchin using the index:

find({$text:{$search:"keywords"}})

note: no need to specify the field "description" as text-index is done only on one field that is self-understood my mongodb.


find({$text:{$search:"red book"}})

Here red and books are both different keywords not one means it will search all docs in index where 'red' and 'book' appears individually.

If 'red' appears in doc that is of 'T-shirt', it will be returned as well. 


To search for specific phrase: use escape sequences

find({$text:{$search:"\"red book\""}})

Now it will search for docs where full 'red book' appears.
